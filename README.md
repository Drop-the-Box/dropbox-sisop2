# dropbox-sisop2
This project involves implementing a service similar to Dropbox, enabling the sharing and automatic synchronization of files across different devices belonging to the same user. The work is divided into two parts. The first part covers topics such as threads, processes, communication using sockets, and process synchronization using mutex and semaphores. Subsequently, new features will be added to the project. The application should run in Unix (Linux) environments, even if it was developed on other platforms. The program should be implemented using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sockets API of Unix and utilizing C/C++.
